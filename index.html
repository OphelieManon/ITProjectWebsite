            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
            Personally, I think this is an interesting and rewarding course, 
            as I could gain more insight into general IT fields that 
            I have not been exposed to before such as Networking and Virtual reality. 
            I believe it would assist me in finding the domains that I am passionate about, 
            and therefore identifying my right career path in the industry. In decision to 
            build a food website, I wish to gain more skills in organizing and conducting 
            a project, as well as HTML/CSS skills in particular. Moreover, I hope that this project’s 
            topic, food and cooking, could motivate me to learn how to cook from my teammates 
            in the near future. <br />
            Hobbies: watching films, hanging out with friends, reading books.  <br />
            </p>
            
            <h4>IT Interest</h4>
            <p>
            I only started to be interested in technology after high school, when 
            I first gained knowledge about how AI was applied to deal with daily life work. I tried to 
            find a career path that could work with that technology, but IT field was so challenging for 
            a girl who never had any experience or interest in this field. After that, I was also exposed 
            to the world of data science, which was a potential career path. With those interests in mind, 
            I decided that IT was a major that I wanted to master, so as to join the AI and data science 
            community. <br />

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p> As a student that joined RMIT during the last semester, I had the opportunity 
                to learn and adapt to the school's learning environment. I also had Dr. Long 
                as my professor in past subjects, which gave me some insight into this project's 
                planning and organization. I hope to use the knowledge that I have acquired so 
                far in SQL and User-Centered Design and put it into practice during this course 
                with my teammates. This project is giving the students a wide range of topics 
                related to IT to choose from, which is a very good incentive for students such as 
                me to present their interest in the field using the methods, they find most suitable. 
                I hope to acquire more experience and skills while working on this project such as 
                mastery in HTML or CSS for an instance as this opportunity will be fundamental for 
                my growth.<br />
                Background: food connoisseur, fashion enthusiast, animal lover, multiple language speaker.<br />
                Hobbies: traveling, cooking, video games.  <br /></p>    
            <h4>IT Interest</h4>
            <p>  
                Having to occasionally travel due to my parents’ line of work, I enjoyed every single one 
                of those travel occasions. But I also had to use different means of communication to stay 
                connected with family and friends. Therefore, I had to use a variety of communication services 
                such as Line, WhatsApp or Messenger which was also my first exposure to Information and 
                Communications Technology. Following my passion for travel, I decided to study economics and 
                management abroad, from which I got introduced to data mining and Information technology. After 
                a while, I decided that I wanted to study Information Technology as I was more intrigued by it 
                and it has more career opportunities. I realized IT is involved with practically everything in 
                our daily lives nowadays and it is a great prospect that enables us to advance in our present 
                society. <br /></p>

            <p> 
                Coming from another branch of education, I was looking forward to my new journey with a 
            degree in Information Technology. As a beginner, I am new to programming languages and 
            the knowledge associated with technology. This project allows me to dive deeper into what 
            IT could do in our practical lives; it is furthermore a way to discover what I am keen 
            on among various IT-related topics. Through this project, I hope to sharpen my HTML/CSS

            <h4>IT Interest</h4>
            <p>
            I started to get interested in technology during high school. Because my advisor was an IT 
            teacher, he usually took us to the Tech studio to play VR games for our advising sessions. 
            I was fascinated with the technology and felt like I was in a different world. After the 
            sessions ended, I kept thinking about the games that I played and how this technology can 
            be utilized outside the studio. Another exposure that I had was attending a 3D Design course 
            during my junior year. During the course, I was always amazed whenever we got to print an object. 
            I thought about how 3D printing could reduce the time building certain items. Through these 
            experiences, I realized the importance of technology in our daily lives and in the near future. <br />

            <h4>Group Processes</h4>
            <p class="description">
                Our group displayed wonderful harmony during the past twelve weeks of this project. Compared 
                to other groups, we had to work a bit harder as there were only three people. For that reason, 
                we focused on utilizing each person's skill to the best. Van monitored the overall progress of 
                the group. Ophelia was in charge of designing the prototype with assistance from everyone. The 
                content was split into smaller parts. Each member was responsible for the parts that they were 
                most skilled in. Hanh was the editor who read and revised the content. As there were many things 
                to do, we maintained effective communication and splendid work ethics. However, we should have 
                paid attention to time management so that we had more ease working on our prototype and checking 
                over our product.
            </p>
            <h4>Career Plan</h4> <br />
            <h5 style="font-size:larger"> Van: Game developer</h5>
            <p>
              A game developer, writes code for several parts of a game development, including visual elements and 
              programming features, such as artificial intelligence, user interface and game logic. You could say 
              that they turn a game idea from just a concept into playable reality.   
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size:larger">Hanh: Back-end web developer</h5> 
            <p>
                A back-end web developer builds and maintains components or features of a website or an app. 
                Back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that user 
                are unable to see on the front side of a website or system. They are required to have technical expertise, 
                analytical thinking, and excellent collaboration skills. 
            </p>  
            <h5 style="font-size:larger"> Ophelie: Data analyst</h5>
            <p> 
                A data analyst is a professional who retrieves, organizes and analyzes information from various sources in
                order to help an organization achieve their business goals. Data analysts use logic, statistical techniques 
                and computer programming as their tools to turn data and numbers into information that an organization can 
                use to improve their business plan. It is important for an analyst to be able to distinguish between what 
                 data is important and what data are of no interest or low importance. </p>
            </p>  
    
            <p>
                Data analysts and back-end web developers have an anchored demand on the industry with a stable median base 
                income, while a game developer is relatively fresh and the demand for this job is reasonably steady, the average 
                median salary is lower compared to the other two careers. However, it is a line of work that is increasingly growing 
                over time thanks to more demand in entertainment specifically in game industry and therefore it won’t be too late until 
                it’s base median salary reaches the same amount as the other two if not even pass them depending on the company you are 
                working for.  <br />
                Data analysts exist everywhere from the healthcare industry to marketing and retail. The most prominent workplaces would 
                be at big investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms. A Back-end web developer can work anywhere. From an office 
                at work or at their own house’s comfort. It is a versatile career, and although it doesn't have an ideal workplace it can 
                branch to various other specializations such as back-end engineers and full-stack web developers that pay more and give more 
                opportunities for success. A game developer, much like a back-end developer can work from anywhere, but their ideal workplace 
                would be a friendly and comfortable environment, as coding can sometimes be exhausting for various reasons, working on a pleasant 
                environment can lessen stress and alleviate pressure to some extent. <br />

            <h4>Overview</h4> <br />
            <h5 style="font-size:larger"> Topic </h5>
            <p>
             Since the first humans started traveling, tasting different cuisines has invariably been a significant part of the experience. 
             People exchange spices and recipes for a chance to recreate them in the comfort of their homes. Today, technology plays a 
             prominent role in introducing people to various kinds of food regardless of location. Applications such as ShopeeFood and 
             GrabFood specialize in delivery services of diverse cuisines so that people can easily enjoy their meals anytime and anywhere. 
             Travel websites like TripAdvisor and Agoda offer a section where tourists can look for recommendations of notable restaurants 
             around the area of their stay and see comments from previous eaters. Thanks to these inventions, people appreciate the diversity 
             of food even more. However, the vast choices of meals can sometimes be an adversary in choosing what to eat. As a group, we 
             proposed a solution to ease this concern. <br />
             In this project, our group has decided to create a website that helps users to produce a selection and its recipe so they can make 
             it on their own; we also present places to eat around the user’s location from their selection. For that purpose, we also restricted 
             our database to only three cuisines: Vietnamese, Chinese, and Korean, as these are the most-favored cuisines in the country based on 
             a survey by Agoda (VietNamNet News 5 June 2019). Our website allows users to go through a quiz that will narrow down the users’ choices 
             until a suitable selection is produced. Users can also look for specific recipes through the search bar and utilize the map we provided 
             to look for nearby restaurants. Furthermore, users can specify their search using the provided filters for a more tailored experience. 
             We also designed some features for the administrator to track the website's activities. Anyone struggling with picking what to eat or 
             to cook would find our website practical and worthwhile. <br />
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size: larger">Motivation</h5>
            <p>
              Going to college is a meaningful milestone in a person's life. It marks the beginning of adulthood with many responsibilities while still 
              presents an incredible sense of freedom. For most of us, college is officially our first time living away from home, meaning living without 
              the company of our parents. Instead of pristine floors and ready-to-wear clothes, these concerns would now fall under our responsibility. 
              Among these concerns, meal preparation takes up most of our daily time. We did not have to worry about food when we were at home because 
              our parents were the ones who cooked. With schoolwork and social commitments, it is challenging to sort out a time for this mundane task 
              and appreciate our meals. As a result, we are determined to resolve this recurring issue to save time and enjoy our food. We are particularly 
              interested in cooking because we do not want to spend money on delivery or eating out all the time. With that in mind, we decided to create a 
              platform where we provide tools for users to reduce the time needed for preparing and choosing meals while exploring multiple cuisines. Our 
              audience are people who have struggled with choosing their meal options and people who want to explore different recipes from many that we 
              offered. <br />
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size: larger"> Landscape </h5>
            <p>
              One of the biggest motivations that led us to this project was the expansive prospect of the market. There was little to no competition as 
              only a few were interested in the appointed problem. There were no notable sites that had the same purpose as ours. The closest thing we 
              encountered was a small food section on BuzzFeed Quiz that offers various quizzes with food as the central subject (BuzzFeed Quiz). However, 
              these quizzes are far from what we envisioned as they give answers entirely irrelevant to our purpose. Despite that, the BuzzFeed Quiz 
              enlightened us on the methods we developed for our website. Another source that helped form our features is TripAdvisor. Essentially a travel 
              website for tourists, TripAdvisor offers a section where visitors can look for restaurants nearby or at their heading location. We found this 
              segment fitting with our purpose and that it would aid other features we had on our website after some improvement. <br />
              Our primary concern is how users can most benefit from our product. Looking at BuzzFeed Quiz, the content of quizzes is vague, making it difficult 
              for visitors to understand despite the transparent design. For TripAdvisor, since its focus is not on food, visitors who require additional information 
              might demand more. Realizing this gap, we strive to create a platform for our audience who want to explore their food journey by implementing tools 
              that provide uncomplicated navigation and content. Through detailed research and analysis, we also seek to improve existing features to their best. 
              By combining what we know and what we learn, users can expect effortless coherence and accurate results when browsing our website. <br />
            </p>
            <h4>Detailed Description</h4> <br />
            <h5 style="font-size: larger"> Aims </h5>
            <p style="font-style:italic"> "We aim to build a community where people can seek help in their meal choices, find distinctive diners, 
                and explore the food scene in Vietnam." </p>
            <p>
                We find the best way to convey our purpose is through a website with many activities for people to look around. Several goals are 
                essential to the success of our project.. <br />
                - To create a meal-choice quiz that effectively generates an answer based on \
                the user's response.<br />
                The majority of quizzes we found on the Internet contain many complicated questions and explanations. This could prevent the user 
                from continuing the quiz as it makes the user tedious. Therefore, we want to build a quiz as brief and concise as possible while 
                the user's need is not ignored. By implementing AI, we can narrow down the number of questions to a preferable amount and generate 
                an answer based on the user's responses. We want them to experience something more exciting than having to look up recipes on their 
                own aimlessly. <br />
                - To have a wide array of unique recipes from diverse sources such as food bloggers or local chefs. <br />
                We want to offer many options to the users from our database of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Korean recipes. We strive to find exceptional 
                recipes from food bloggers or local chefs that are dedicated to these cuisines. From simple to restaurant-worthy meals, there are all 
                kinds of recipes fitted to the user's cooking ability. <br />
                - To encourage the user to provide their rating and review on recipes or restaurants they have tried. <br />
                Like how we make choices through our research and advice from people we trust, ratings and reviews are key factors that help the user 
                in the process of selecting an item. As mentioned before, we want to form a community with our users, making this platform a memorable 
                place. Through users' ratings and reviews, we hope to gain the trust of our users, and hence boost our growth even more. To achieve this, 
                we aim to build a user-friendly interface so that users are motivated to post their opinions. <br />
                - To suggest nearby restaurants to users as an alternative when they are not in the mood to cook. <br />
                Admittedly, preparing a meal takes a lot of time and energy despite the excitement during the process. There are days you want to wipe up 
                a big meal, but some days you are too busy or unmotivated to step into the kitchen. For this reason, we introduce a feature that shows users 
                nearby restaurants based on their location. We want users to explore food not only through cooking but also through trips to local cafes and 
                diners. Not only can users find many restaurants around them, but they can also discover restaurants that they have never tried before.

            <h5 style="font-size: larger"> Plans and progress</h5>
            <p>
                This project will be managed and controlled using the Scrum methodology which follows 12 Agile principles created by Beck et al (2001) as we 
                consider it suitable for a small-scale and team-based project. Moreover, this methodology allows us to be more flexible in managing the features, 
                such as adding or removing features along the way. Furthermore, each feature will be reviewed respectively at the end of the Sprint before moving 
                to the next stage to avoid being overwhelmed by the workload.  <br />
                However, our project only focuses on proposing an idea and building a prototype, so the prototyping process is divided into seven phases for ease 
                of management. The methodology is applied but modified to suit our working style. Particularly: <br />
                •	Each Sprint lasts one week, and a meeting (mostly offline) will be conducted once a week. <br />
                •	Each meeting includes: <br />
                    o	Reviewing the Sprint: examining if the functionalities are displayed satisfactorily in the prototype website, and re-evaluating unfinished work.  
                        No real testing was included as the nature of the project does not include building a real website. <br />
                    o	Planning for the next Sprint: assigning the following tasks and modifying the scope if needed. <br />
                At the beginning, we used two weeks to familiarize ourselves with Figma and brainstorm our ideas. We started building and working on the prototype after 
                the project proposal feedback from the teacher. Hanh spent about a week looking for the Quiz section content, while in the meantime, Van worked on different 
                other contents like the Homepage and a few others. Ophelie on the other hand, worked on the design of the prototype by creating the frames and the layout 
                with any text. It took about 2 weeks for Ophelie to almost finish the frames for the website while the others would slowly fill in the content and we would 
                gradually see results during week 6. Around week 7 was when we realized some big modifications had to be made for the design, so it took us quite some time 
                until week 8 to finish the prototype, at least the features that we displayed on the timetable and scope. We used the remaining weeks to work on the final 
                report and the making of the website for our report. <br />
                During the process, we first started dividing the wireframes we had to create and then discussed the results. Once we agreed on the appropriate design for them, 
                Ophelie started creating the frames on Figma while Van and Hanh worked on the contents of the Quiz and gathered the pictures used for the website. Ophelie took 
                some time finding the right color palette to use, but then we all decided to go for pastel colors because it seemed to fit more on our theme. It was also pleasant 
                to the eye of the users. We had to also do some research online to have an idea of how a website layout was built. After half of the work achieved, we focused 
                on updating the project report to keep ourselves up to date. We would contact each other at least twice a week and meet once a week to exchange the work we have 
                done. For instance, every time Ophelie was done with a frame, she would ask either Van or Hanh to help with writing the content of the frame. That is how we proceeded 
                until the completion of the prototype. There are a few parts that we did not finish or did at all, for example, we did not create a page for every local restaurant 
                or every single recipe on the website as we were too short on time. However, we made sure to at least have one example for each instance, in order to be able to demonstrate 
                them during the presentation day. Van also helped out with linking the frames together. Thanks to everyone’s contributions, we came so far to deliver a prototype and 
                accomplish most of our team’s, as well as each individual’s goals we had set out at the beginning of the project. <br />
                We experienced a communication breakdown among members in the period of W8 – W10, due to the fact that we got overwhelmed by other courses’ deadlines. Therefore, we 
                could not set up a meeting weekly, but instead, we still stayed in touch on Messager and notified one another if there were any problems popped up. However, the consequence 
                of that problem was the delay in completing the prototype, and we also had only one week to do both the report content and build an HTML webpage for it. During that week, 
                Van was in charge of building the webpage and helping with the report, while Ophelie and Hanh worked on the report content. After a harsh week, we finally managed to complete 
                the project and proposed it in the presentation. <br />

              Van - Project leader <br />
              - Track the progress of the whole team. <br />
              - Build HTML website. <br />
              - Support for building the prototype, including connecting the frames and testing the prototype. <br />

            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size:larger"> Scope and limits </h5>
            <p>
                The website intends to be a platform that focuses on food- or cooking-related content. Some of the 
                features include: <br />
                •	Give recipe/ food suggestions for the users who have no idea what to eat based on the users’ preferences. <br />
                •	Provide information on the recipes related to three cuisines: Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese. <br />
                •	Give recommendations of nearby restaurants based on the user’s location. <br />
                •	Users who sign up for member accounts will be able to save recipes/restaurants for future use as well as send their 
                meal requests to the website’s administrator. <br />
                •	The website’s admin(s) will be able to manage the posts, track the website traffic, and view requests from users. <br />
                We realized the website needs evaluation from both the designer’s and the user’s perspectives. Therefore, Ten Usability Heuristics 
                (Nielsen, 1994) will be applied in order to deliver a high-quality and practical website for our users. <br />
                By the end of the semester, we were not able to create a website due to the lack of knowledge as first-year students in IT, and some 
                features could have been too ambitious.  We opted for the prototyping of our project, and we could have displayed all of the features 
                we planned out except a few features. For instance, we wanted the users to be able to view the history of the recipes they previously 
                checked. Instead, we did not make it happen. However, users will be able to save their favorite recipes or local restaurants only if 
                they are logged into their accounts. We couldn’t display all filter options, so some of them have been incomplete as we lacked some 
                knowledge of how to perfectly use Figma. The layout of the page where the Admin gets to manage the recipe posts has not been bought 
                to perfection. Although we did not implement all possible AI answers, we did make an example in the prototype that displays how it 
                would work. <br />
                With everything being said, we included a login and sign-up page for members and admin. The admin just has to log in like any member 
                and the system would recognize it based on its username and then they will have access to the admin dashboard. Regardless of users’ 
                choice to sign in or not, they will be able to access most of our content apart from sharing a review, comment or like and saving a 
                recipe as an example. Anyone can do the quiz, and look up recipes and local restaurants. Another feature that has not been in the 
                prototype is the permission request to have access to the user’s location.  On a restaurant page, we included as an example, the layout 
                but we additionally inserted a mini-map of the location of the restaurant. One of the most important features that we have originally 
                thought of not including is the reviews but after further research, we realized that it is an extremely important aspect of our project. 
                The reviews are what will encourage people to use our website, and with no trace of past users’ opinions, it might lead to disbelief in 
                our content. This is the reason why we want to develop a good customer experience and have them remain long-term users.
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size:larger">Tools and technology </h5>
            <p>
                1. Figma <br />
                Figma is used at the stage of prototype design to build the UI for our website. With Figma, we can create clickable buttons that direct to 
                other pages like the real website, so that we can interact with the prototype and test the functionalities before the actual implementation. 
                Figma also supports a variety of extensions, which assist us in constructing an aesthetic and like-real user interface. Therefore, we prioritize 
                Figma over other existing designing tools. <br />
                2. Oracle Apex and SQL <br />
                As Van and Ophelie have had prior experience with this low-code environment from the other course, we plan to build a simple database system for 
                management. The system will connect with the website to store some necessary information for further analysis such as the user’s profile and 
                browsing history. The analysis will be conducted with SQL, a language used to manipulate the database to figure out the trends, and user tendencies. 
                The programming process will be done via PyCharm Ultimate, which supports database management and the SQL language, as it provides free accounts for 
                students. <br />
                3. AI <br />
                AI is planned to be included on the website in the future. This powerful technology will be used not only to generate the quiz answers but also to 
                analyze the user’s behaviors to provide the website content based on individual preferences. To put that intention into practice, we plan to gain more 
                knowledge about this technology through Google AI. <br />
                4. Github <br />
                We consider Github as an ideal channel for website construction and free hosting without having to buy a website domain. The power of Git allows us to 
                collaborate to build the website, particularly, we can work on separate branches and push to the main branch, so as to avoid conflicts among members’ 
                work. With Github, we can also reverse the code’s history if unwanted changes occur. <br />
                5. Visual Studio Code <br />
                We realize that Visual Studio Code is a comprehensive environment for programming, as we can work on multiple languages together, just by installing 
                the extensions of a particular language. That is convenient for us because we do not need to switch to another interpreter to code another language, 
                like when we previously worked with Java on IntelliJ IDEA and Python on PyCharm. Besides, Visual Studio Code is relatively fully functional even when 
                it is free, unlike other environments in which we need the ultimate package. <br />
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size:larger">Testing </h5>
            <p>
                Coming to the testing part of our prototype, it mostly came from people’s opinions about the features and interface. At first, we analyzed who our target 
                audience would be. We have decided to select people that would usually travel, people from the age of 20-40, and people interested in food. The reason why 
                we picked out those criteria is that the people that travel would usually be in need of a website or application that could help them discover the local food 
                in the foreign country. Generally, people who cook are students that live alone or people that are into culinary. Moreover, we also chose people that would 
                often use their devices or have internet access everywhere.  <br />
                After determining our population sample, we had to find individuals that would volunteer to share their thoughts on our project. We mainly asked our friends, 
                family, and comrades because most of them would fit the criteria while not having any kind of biased judgment. We interrogated around 18 people through calls 
                or face-to-face meetings and most of them did like the idea. Some of them suggested a few changes to our UI which helped us improve our prototype during the 
                making. We would either screen-share our current work or show them directly the work. Most of them were interested in our quiz and found it not only interesting 
                but also entertaining. Our second main feature revolved around the suggestions of recipes that complemented well with the Quiz and if they did not want to cook 
                we would offer them local restaurants. Approximately, if we end up in the process or future to implement an actual website with its features, we would need at 
                least 40 people to test our website realistically.  Although, so far, the opinions were relatively positive and our features seemed quite realistic and reasonable 
                to implement.
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size:larger">Risks</h5>
            <p>
                Here are further potential risks we identified throughout the process of this project:<br />
                1. Teamwork <br />
                We believe that communication and working together can quickly become a huge internal issue for our project. To build a website or any type of application, we are 
                constantly brainstorming and coming up with new ideas. Of course, it is important to test out those ideas, but if each member starts thinking individually or for 
                their own gain without sharing their opinions with the team, the project is prone to fail. Everyone needs to work at the same pace and share any kind of thoughts 
                that come to their mind about the project. We strongly believe that no matter what kind of relationship we have with each other, we should always keep in mind that 
                this is work-related, and success only comes through cooperation and hard work. Up to this point, our group has not encountered a lot of problems regarding team 
                communication. It primarily improved over time as a result of our efforts, but as each individual in this group has a different opinion regarding the project, it 
                is also one of the main risks that could contribute to the team’s blunder. <br />
                2. AI implementation <br />
                Since our project’s main features revolve around those technologies, we firmly believe that AI/AR implementation is a very complex subject as it is a popular trend 
                which is still under a lot of ongoing research and development and therefore it is an expanding market. We might not have the appropriate knowledge to implement it 
                directly to our project yet, even with prior research. It would require actual professionals in the field to help us build the AI and AR technologies on our website. 
                It is indeed, a risk to take, due to our unfamiliarity with the field, and perhaps some of the features might be too complicated to apply to our project. Up until 
                now, we have come up with a simple quiz. The research of the questions should be realistically possible but implementing AI technology with that is out of our reach. 
                As a result, it was impossible to proceed any further than the prototype. More selective and professional expertise is called for such a demanding approach regarding 
                our final project. <br />
                3. Budget and source of income
                If we were to think on a larger scale for the project and we had to find investors to help us realize it, we would need to put more effort into managing and accessing  
                financial investment plans and all sorts of possible outcomes our project would ever come across. It is necessary to express the importance of maintaining our product 
                through various means, mainly monetary such the budget required to host the website and to hire people involved with its management. We must find the means to earn a 
                sustainable amount of capital in order to support and sustain our project. Essential skills and knowledge, such as marketing and business management, are needed for 
                such an endeavor in order to promote our product. What happens when the website does not become a success, how do we foresee the outcome of the final product and how 
                do we prevent a bad outcome. These are all questions we come to ask ourselves when it comes to the making of a product or a service. It is exactly why a business plan 
                is required to be made that doesn’t lead us to any funding risk. <br />
                4. Sampling of the population <br />
                There’s a risk that also comes from testing our product and how impartial the results that we have collected can be. It is important to find a target audience to sample 
                our product. It could become a risk if, on a much larger scale, we could not fulfill some reasonable expectations the users of our product have. We would have inevitably 
                failed to answer our consumers’ needs would have to start from scratch all over again. Finding people that meet the criteria to complete our survey or test our product 
                directly could be hard to look for on a very wide-ranging level. Those are risks that should not be overlooked since they primarily help with the success of the idea 
                and the finalizing of the project.  <br />

            </p>
            <h5 style="font-size:larger"> Group proccesses and communications </h5>
            <p>
                For planning and organizing, our group has decided to schedule at least one offline meeting per week to review the sprint, which consists of checking the group’s progress, 
                testing the features, and fixing bugs. We will also plan for the next week and assign tasks among ourselves. If needed, we would modify the scope to produce the best results. 
                In the case of an emergency meeting is needed, we will schedule it through a group call via Teams or Facebook Messenger. As for the team’s communication means, we will be 
                using Facebook Messenger as our primary source of communication as it is the easiest way to get hold of everyone. School emails and OneDrive will also be used to store our 
                important work resources. <br />
                In case of miscommunication from an individual, the team will first try to reach the teammate through all means including but not limited to phone texts, emails, and calls. 
                If the other party does not respond within 48 hours, they will be responsible for consequences such as a 0% contribution grade and elimination from the group project. <br />

              <h4> Product prototype </h4>  
              <p>
                With short-time duration of this project, we decided to build an interactive prototype using Figma, which could be clicked on just like the real website. 
                Although the prototype is at an early stage, we manage to implement basic features stated in the scope, with additional features in the out-of-scope section. 
                Please visit this link to view and interact with the Figma prototype: <br/>
                <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.figma.com/file/JU2p9ehBxlHwXoBVQ1upkw/CookingLand?node-id=0%3A1&t=YEjheVJ4N7Bq1Jgl-1">https://www.figma.com/file/JU2p9ehBxlHwXoBVQ1upkw/CookingLand?node-id=0%3A1&t=YEjheVJ4N7Bq1Jgl-1</a>
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size:larger">Homepage</h5>
              <p>
                When the users click on the link to the website, they can see the Homepage, containing brief descriptions of other sections: Recipes, Restaurants, and About us. 
                Two ways of accessing other pages are provided for the users, they can switch to a desired page either by clicking on the navigation bar or the “Find more” button 
                below each section’s introduction. 
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: larger">Quiz</h5>
              <p>
                The main purpose of this section, also the overall goal of the website, is to suggest visitors what to eat when they are overwhelmed with a variety of choices. With that 
                intention in mind, we provide the Quiz section, containing 8 to 10 short multiple-choice questions. After the users complete the quiz, AI technology is applied to collect 
                their answers and recommend one dish that matches their preferences. The answer will be generated from our food database. 
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: larger">Recipes</h5>
              <p>
                On the Recipes page, the recipes are divided into 3 categories: Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese. The data from this page is also utilized to suggest the dishes in the Quiz 
                section. The visitors choose a recipe by clicking on the photo of one dish, and they can view the detailed description of how to prepare the ingredients and cook, as well 
                as the difficulty level of cooking that dish. <br />
                recipes for a dish could be contributed either by the members or the admin of the website. The members could also comment and rate a particular recipe, which could act as 
                a reference for other users.
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: larger">Restaurants</h5>
              <p>
                This page recommends popular local restaurants/cafes that serve Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese food, in case the users do not feel like cooking on their own. The page has 
                two modes: normal recommendations and custom recommendations. If location tracking is not allowed by the users, the page will display all the restaurants in the country. 
                Otherwise, GPS will be used to filter the restaurants nearby the users’ location. Furthermore, the users can sort the restaurants by price range or types of food/drink. <br />
                A specific restaurant page consists of the address, telephone, ratings, and reviews from other users, like the Recipes page. Apart from that, the menu of the restaurant will 
                be displayed, along with the embedded Google Map showing the exact location. We believe the map could assist the users, especially those who are not local, in easily following 
                the direction to the desired place. 
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: larger">Account</h5>
              <p>
                The website provides three modes of user: Normal visitor, Member, and Admin. The visitors can sign up/sign in by clicking on the “human” icon on the top right of the navigation 
                bar. After that, they need to fill in a form with their username and password. <br />
                When logging in successfully, the user will click the “house” button to be directed to the homepage. If the users forget the password, we provide an option of sending a password 
                reset link to the user’s email. <br />
                1. Member <br />
                When the members successfully sign in/sign up, they can click the “human” icon on the menu bar again to perform actions. A member will be able to access his/her profile and contribute 
                to the content or send requests to the Admin through Google Forms. The members could also save favorite recipes/restaurants for future use by clicking on the ‘heart’ button placed on 
                the picture. <br />
                2. Admin <br />
                The Admin manages the posts and examines the content quality. That means he/she can create, update and delete a specific piece of content. A dashboard will be provided for the Admin 
                to track the website traffic and view the statistics analyzed from the database system linked to the website. <br />
                <h4> Completion and improvement plan </h4>
                <p>
                    We are currently in the prototype design phase, so the website has yet to be in use. However, with the partly completed prototype, we have got an overall idea about how each function 
                    in the scope defined works and its limitations, so as to decide whether to add or remove redundant features in the future. The process of designing the UI at first could facilitate the 
                    real construction process. <br />
                    To make the website available for the public, we still need to go through multiple processes of constructing, debugging and testing to meet the user’s needs. Once we are through the implementation 
                    of the project, we are planning to expand much further. We want to attract as many users as possible. In order to accomplish such ambitious goals, we are planning to add more Asian cuisines such as 
                    Japanese and Thai cuisines. We also want to promote our website through social media. For instance, there are a lot of trendy foodie influences today, whom we could sign contracts with to promote our 
                    website. We would also like to sign partnerships with local restaurants as a source of income to promote their business on our website. As for the user’s quality of life experience, we’re planning 
                    to allow the users to make direct reservations through our website and have access to AR map navigation. We also want to make a phone application version of our website compatible through all OS and we 
                    want to enhance our user interface for the best possible experience. <br />

                In this project, my responsibility is to assist Ophelie in building the prototype on Figma, and building the HTML web for our report. With my second experience in planning for the whole IT project, I mostly 
                struggled with time management. The cooperation among team members is effective, however, we experienced a communication breakdown in the middle of the semester as we were overwhelmed by other courses, which 
                resulted in us hardly having a meeting to discuss our work. Therefore, it took us longer than expected to finalize the prototype, as we needed to change the layout and design twice, without considering the time 
                to prepare for the report and presentation, which made us eventually behind the planned timetable. Nevertheless, the working process still happened smoothly after that period, and I learn that we need to consistently 
                keep track of each other’s work and communicate more frequently to discuss the work so that if anyone is behind, another member can always back up. Besides, working with HTML/CSS is a whole new experience for me, as 
                now I can have knowledge of how a website is constructed. Building our own website was a challenging task, which took me a lot of time to research by myself, and I realized that I need to train my coding and designing 
                skills to build a more usable website.

                There were many things that I learned from working on this project. During the brainstorming session, I suggested we create a cooking website to help those in need, and luckily, the idea was chosen. I was in charge of 
                constructing the quiz, which was the main part of the website. As I started my research, I was overwhelmed with the vast amount of data, and hence, clueless about how to successfully form the quiz. Furthermore, researching 
                became harder as commitments from other classes started to kick in. It took me several weeks before I finalized the content of the quiz. Throughout this process, my teammates were extremely great about communicating and 
                dividing the tasks. I was trusted with editing pieces of writing for the group. It made me feel valuable and sorry at the same time because I could not assist them much with the coding as I was not as skilled as my teammates.
                 Despite that, we all did very well with our tasks and completed the prototype without much issue. This opportunity again taught me about my strengths and weaknesses as a team player and showed me the factors of a great 
                 collaboration as well as a weak one. I was happy to be able to contribute my part and grateful for my teammates.

                This project has taught me a lot of things during its process. I was in charge of designing the Prototype on Figma and it made me realize that I had an affinity to designing. It is surprising since it has given me another path 
                I could pursue with my career. It took me at least two weeks to work on the project. I encountered some errors during the making so I had to go back and forth, consult with my teammates to receive feedback, and make the necessary 
                changes based on what we agreed. Initially, I was the team’s prototype tester, but the role changed, and I became the one working on the layout of the content. Everyone did their parts, and all contributed equally. Van helped me 
                with the buttons. She was extremely helpful when it came to our website's content. Meanwhile, Hanh fulfilled her part of working on our main feature: the quiz which took some research. She also helped with the writing of the contents. 
                I feel incredibly pleased with the work everyone has contributed. We ended up finalizing our project. However, it is my belief that we should have planned out our schedule better for the report, as it ended up clashing with some other 
                subjects. It is something that we could have done better. This is once again, another group project that made me learn how to work efficiently as a team member and encourage people around me to not give up during challenges. We understood 
                more about each other's strengths and weaknesses which will help us improve in future projects.

                Compared to other classes' group projects, this project ran from the first week of school until the last week. This advantage gave us more time to work on our project and refine our prototype. We started with the cooking website idea, which we 
                thought was unique as it was simple and intriguing, yet few paid attention to it. When we divided our tasks, everyone was active and took on parts that each felt confident in doing. We were always in contact to guarantee that our work stayed 
                close to our purpose and that we were coordinated. When we finished the assigned tasks, we set up a meeting to check in and revise our work. Most of the deadlines were met and we were able to bring our efforts into the prototype. <br />
                Despite the great teamwork we had, inevitably, there were some challenges during the process. The time advantage that we had harmed us midway as we underestimated the workload of this project. We delayed our deadlines to be available for other 
                classes, thinking we could still finish our project on time. For this reason, we had to rush toward the end to complete our prototype, report, and website. As different classes assignments kicked in, we also had to focus less on this project and 
                concentrate on other commitments. Fortunately, we realized our problem and worked together at the last minute. Another difficulty we encountered was the limit of our skillset. As beginners in IT, we had to learn how to use our tools, such as Figma, 
                for this project. This process took a substantial chunk of our time as we tried to visualize our prototype through the skills we just absorbed. Writing the report also took a lot of time because we were not familiar with the format. The hardest part 
                though would be coding the website. Before this course, none of us had any experience with HTML. Therefore, it was hard for us to code the website on top of the shortened timespan. Although there were many difficulties, we tried to stay active and 
                focused during our meetings so that we could discuss and solve problems together. <br />
                Being smart with time management is the most significant thing all three of us realized while working on this project. The distractions we experienced during the process threw us far from our tracks, and it would have been worse if we did not recognize 
                our problem later on. Once again, we acknowledge the importance of communication within the group. Without checking in with each other, we would have failed to fix our problems and accordingly, we would not be able to finish our project.
